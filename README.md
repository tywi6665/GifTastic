###Overview:

For this assignment, the objective was to create a web that made use of the Giphy API. Preset buttons were connected to the API and would change teh search URL resulting in different objects from the API. Ten GIFs then were appended to the page. A user is able to add a button by inputing text into  a search bar. The new button is then appended to the page with the same functionality as the original buttons. GIFs can also be started and stopped by clicking on them. 

###Design Notes:

* Start with a predetermined set of buttons
	* Have each button connect to the Giphy API by manipulating its URL
	* Destination
* Have a search bar
    * When text is input in the search bar, a new button is created
    * That new button is also now connected to Giphy API
* Have the clicked buttons diplay a preset number of GIFs to the page
* Each GIF must be able to be started and paused by clicking on said GIF
